title: About me
---


 I graduated from Digipen Institute of Technology in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program in 2017. Starting my junior year, I interned for the Research and Development department at DigiPen to work on the Zero Engine. That then turned into a full-time position once I graduated. While there I maintained and improved the Buildbot build server, rewrote the documentation tool that created the code reference, and migrated the entire project to a CMake project. While initially only really interested in core engine development, during my time on Zero time I found I also had an interest in build (and prebuild) systems.
