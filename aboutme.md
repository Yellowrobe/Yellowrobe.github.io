### My history

I taught myself the C Programming Language in High School and I have been programming since. Currently I am a Junior at Digipen Institute of Technology in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program. I am currently working in DigiPen's Research and Development department on documentation tools and maintaining our Buildbot server. When not programming, I spend my time playing Dungeons and Dragons, playing guitar, and thinking about programming.
