What else do you need?

### my history

I Taught myself the C Programming Language in High School and I have been programming since. Currently I am a Junior at Digipen Institute of Technology in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program. I currently spend most of my time writing AI systems and behaviors in C++ for my [current game](/projects/retrospect/). When not programming, I spend my time playing Dungeons and Dragons, playing guitar, and thinking about programming.
