##AI and Gameplay Programmer  

#####Team Bear King  
**DigiPen Sophomore Project**


Genetic Drift is a top-down, twin-stick shooter where players engineer micro-organisms for battle by choosing the DNA sequences their micro-organisms inherit. There are seven DNA sequences (abilities), each with their own mutations that can change how the inherited sequence works. Genetic Drift encourages players to choose their own playstyles through the abilities they select, and to enjoy the bragging rights that come with beating your friends over and over again in a game of superior genes. Features AI opponents to fill empty player slots.

Download the game from the Digipen Game Gallery [here.](http://games.digipen.edu/games/genetic-drift) (recommended 2-4 players)

###What I Did

* Co-wrote a Goal-Oriented Action Planning(GOAP) implementation for emergent AI behavior. Jordan Ellis and I's research paper on the implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Yellowrobe/GOAP-Implementation)
* Extensive use of the engines timer and lerp systems to create level events that made the game feel a lot more hectic, increasing player engagement
* Created upgradeable player abilities that gave the player finer customization of their character, making each player's character feel unique to their playstyle

###Tools and Languages Used

* C++
