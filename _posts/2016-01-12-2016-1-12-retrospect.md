![Gameplay video coming soon. Game Still in development. Run cycle created by Michael Schabbing]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Update Run Cycle.gif)


##AI Programmer  

#####Team Bear King  
**Junior Project**


Retrospect is a split-screen first person shooter where as new rounds of the game start, clones of your past lives replay the previous rounds inputs. Once out of inputs, the AI kicks in and they become useful allys. This year's Retrocup is being hosted by the planet Spoignion, known for their adorable squeaky inhabitants and their main export: pudding. The Hivemind, creators of Retrospect, have hand selected the two mightiest lifeforms on the planet, used the powers of science and space wizardry to enhance their already intimidating physiques, and through the power of space cloning(tm) generated an army of contestants for the galaxy to witness. In this fast paced and complex tactical first person shooter you will find you and your clones, known as echoes, battling your way into the hearts of over 4000 galactic species and any other inferior species that own satellite televisions. In the words of Jarlyc, the first ever champion clone of Retrospect, “Run the point straight up to the score zone and be sure to land and stick the goal.”

Retrospect is still in development as a Junior

###What I Did

* Implemented waypoint pathing system for easily defined walkable paths
* Created waypoint connector tool for Team Bear King's custom editor, speeding up level creation
* Designed steering behavior systems utilizing behavior groups, allowing for fine tuning of how AI moved and easy creation of new steering behaviors by combining simple building blocks
* Tested AI systems in Unity C# then ported them to Team Bear King's custom C++ Engine for rapid prototyping of both AI systems and the game itself
* Currently working on a new behavior tree system to allow for more complex AI reasoning (and because behavior trees are super cool!)

###Tools and Languages Used

* C++
* C#
* Haxe
* Unity
