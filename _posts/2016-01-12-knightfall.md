Knightfall is a magical, 2D, real-time, combat-oriented platforming race for treasure and victory. Traverse through randomly generated dungeons with endless re-playability! Encounter all the dungeon's traps and challenges as the mage Blinky. These dungeons feature several dangerous creatures, such as fluttering bats, creepy spiders, and evil golden knights as well as merciless traps including sharp darts, spikes, and looming chandeliers. To thwart these foes, Blinky must use his awesome powers such as Kinetic Punch, Levitation, and a Magic Orb. Along the way he will find loads of loot to collect. So enter Castle Knightfall... if you dare!
