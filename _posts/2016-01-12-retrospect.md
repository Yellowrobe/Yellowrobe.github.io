## AI Programmer  

##### Team Bear King  
**DigiPen Junior Project**

Rafflesia is a sci-fi first-person shooter where players assume the role of two exterminators that take on the biggest problems. A colossal corpse flower has taken over a sewage treatment plant and has to be stopped before the surrounding metropolis is destroyed. Get ready to take on an enemy of gigantic proportions inside a deadly sewer.

### What I Did

* Created waypoint connector tool for Team Bear King's custom editor, speeding up level creation
* Designed  a modular, data-driven steering behavior system for easy behavior generation
* Tested AI systems in Unity C# then ported them to Team Bear King's custom C++ Engine for rapid prototyping of AI systems, which gave the designers a chance to build gameplay around the AI early
* Worked with a designer to realize the behaviors in their mind map, allowing AI to match the game vision

### Tools and Languages Used

* C++
* C#
* Haxe
* Unity
