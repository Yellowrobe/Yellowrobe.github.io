Retrospect is a split-screen first person shooter where as new rounds of the game start, clones of your past lives replay the previous rounds inputs. Once out of inputs, the AI kicks in and they become useful allys. This year's Retrocup is being hosted by the planet Spoignion, known for their adorable squeaky inhabitants and their main export: pudding. The Hivemind, creators of Retrospect, have hand selected the two mightiest lifeforms on the planet, used the powers of science and space wizardry to enhance their already intimidating physiques, and through the power of space cloning(tm) generated an army of contestants for the galaxy to witness. In this fast paced and complex tactical first person shooter you will find you and your clones, known as echoes, battling your way into the hearts of over 4000 galactic species and any other inferior species that own satellite televisions. In the words of Jarlyc, the first ever champion clone of Retrospect, “Run the point straight up to the score zone and be sure to land and stick the goal.”

Retrospect is still in development as a Junior game project at DigiPen Institute of Technology

###What I Did

* Authored an easily extendable waypoint pathing system that allowed for fast addition of new features
* Created waypoint connector tool for Team Bear King's custom editor, speeding up level creation
* Designed  a modular, data-driven steering behavior system for easy behavior generation
* Tested AI systems in Unity C# then ported them to Team Bear King's custom C++ Engine for rapid prototyping of AI systems, which gave the designers a chance to build gameplay around the AI early
* Worked with a designer to realize the behaviors in their mind map, allowing AI to match the game vision
* Currently working on a new behavior tree system to allow for more complex AI reasoning (and because behavior trees are super cool!)

###Tools and Languages Used

* C++
* C#
* Haxe
* Unity
